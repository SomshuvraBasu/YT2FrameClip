# Automatic Video Frame Extraction and Clip Creation from YouTube videos

This Python script allows users to download YouTube videos, extract frames, and create video clips based on specified timestamps.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pytube opencv-python-headless
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Download a YouTube Video

Use the `download_video` function to download a YouTube video. You can specify the resolution of the video to download.

```python
from pytube import YouTube
import os

def download_video(url):
    # Function to download a YouTube video
    pass
```

Example:
```python
video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id"
download_video(video_url)
```

### Step 2: Extract Frames from Video

Extract frames from the downloaded video based on specified start and end timestamps.

```python
import cv2
import os

def extract_frames(video_path, output_folder, start_time, end_time):
    # Function to extract frames from a video
    pass
```

Example:
```python
video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
output_folder = "output/frames"
start_time = "00:01"
end_time = "00:10"
extract_frames(video_path, output_folder, start_time, end_time)
```

### Step 3: Create Video Clip

Create a video clip from the downloaded video based on specified start and end timestamps.

```python
import subprocess

def create_video_clip(video_path, output_folder, start_time, end_time):
    # Function to create a video clip from a video
    pass
```

Example:
```python
video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
output_folder = "output/clips"
start_time = 1  # in seconds
end_time = 10   # in seconds
create_video_clip(video_path, output_folder, start_time, end_time)
```
